add_month_year <- function(file_name, df){
  '
  Function which extracts month and year from file name (the only place where we have this info)
  Extracts Store ID information from store_number column (last 3 digits of long numbers)
  It adds this information as columns to identify the data and be able to join it with other data
  The function also splits data into used part (totals) and part which is not of primary focus for us (rest)
  THINK - The last step could be moved to separate function
  inputs:
    -> file_name (string) - relative path to processed file
    -> df (data.frame) - data.frame obtained by reading in the file
  output:
    <- ls_df (list) - the list of 2 data.frames: totals (used data) and rest (GROSS / RETAIL etc.)
